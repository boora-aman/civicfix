## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/civicfix.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Set up a PostgreSQL database**
   
   **Option 1: Vercel Postgres (Recommended)**
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and create an account if you don't have one
   - Create a new project and connect your GitHub repository
   - In the project settings, go to "Storage" and select "Connect Store"
   - Choose "Vercel Postgres" and follow the setup wizard
   - Vercel will automatically add the `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable to your project

   **Option 2: Railway**
   - Go to [Railway](https://railway.app/) and create an account
   - Create a new project and select "Provision PostgreSQL"
   - Once created, go to "Connect" and copy the connection URL
   - In Vercel, add this URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

   **Option 3: Supabase**
   - Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create an account
   - Create a new project
   - Go to "Settings" > "Database" and copy the connection string
   - In Vercel, add this URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

   **Option 4: Neon**
   - Go to [Neon](https://neon.tech/) and create an account
   - Create a new project
   - Copy the connection string from the dashboard
   - In Vercel, add this URL as the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

3. **Configure environment variables in Vercel**
   - In your Vercel project settings, go to "Environment Variables"
   - Add the following variables:
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
     - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your Vercel deployment URL (e.g., `https://civicfix.vercel.app`)
     - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A random string for session encryption (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)

4. **Deploy your application**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy your application when you push to your GitHub repository
   - You can also manually deploy from the Vercel dashboard

5. **Run database migrations**
   - After deployment, you need to run your Prisma migrations
   - You can do this by adding a build command in your `package.json`:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "vercel-build": "prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && next build"
     }
     ```
   - Or by running the migrations manually:
     ```bash
     npx prisma migrate deploy
     ```

6. **Seed the database (optional)**
   - If you want to seed the database with test data, you can run:
     ```bash
     npx prisma db seed
     ```
   - Or add it to your build command:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "vercel-build": "prisma generate && prisma migrate deploy && prisma db seed && next build"
     }
     ```

### Troubleshooting Deployment

- **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure your database connection string is correct and the database is accessible from Vercel's servers
- **Authentication Problems**: Make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to your production URL
- **Migration Errors**: Check that your Prisma schema is compatible with your database provider
